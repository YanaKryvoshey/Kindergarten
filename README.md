# Kindergarten
This is a code for a kindergarten app, the main screen has 4 options: logIn / logOut, add a kindergarten to the map, see the kindergartens on the map
and if the user is a teacher he can write messages to parents and if the user is a parent he can reads messages from the kindergarten teacher.
From the map you can have a look and see the garden profile which includes information about the garden, information about the gardeners teachers and photos of the garden.
Teacher can only send a message to parents that their children are in the kindergarten where he works,
and  parent can nly read message from the kindergarten teachers.
The login is one-time and is done by sending an SMS with a password.
In this app I used Fairbase to save all the kindergartens, all the teachers and all the children, 
in addition I also saved pictures of the kindergarten teachers and kindergartens pictures in the Storage and the link to the pictures i save in Realtime Database.
